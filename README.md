# CoordinateTool

This plugin provides the same function as Dinnerbone's coordinate tools .

It simply displays the region file, which stores the map data for the specified location or where you're standing along with its chunks and blocks coverage.

Placeholder: PAPI-CoordinateTool (which is available via ecloud) 
NOTE: PAPI expansion is already included in this plugin and you no longer need to install PAPI-CoordinateTool expansion separately.
